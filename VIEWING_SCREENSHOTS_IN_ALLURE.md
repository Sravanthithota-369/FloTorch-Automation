allure-results/screenshots/
â”œâ”€â”€ Before_Entering_Email-[timestamp].png
â”œâ”€â”€ After_Entering_Email-[timestamp].png
â”œâ”€â”€ Before_Clicking_Login_Button-[timestamp].png
â”œâ”€â”€ After_Clicking_Login_Button-[timestamp].png
â”œâ”€â”€ success-[scenario]-[timestamp].png
â””â”€â”€ failed-[scenario]-[timestamp].png
```

### 6. **What Was Fixed**

**Previous Issue**: Screenshots were being captured but not properly attached to Allure
**Root Cause**: Using image buffers instead of file paths for attachments
**Solution Applied**:
- Updated `BasePage.captureScreenshotForAllure()` to save screenshots as files
- Modified step definitions to read screenshot files and attach them properly
- Updated hooks to use file-based screenshot attachments
- Added helper function `attachScreenshotToAllure()` for consistent attachment handling

### 7. **Verification**

To verify screenshots are working:
1. Run any test with screenshots: `npx cucumber-js features/screenshot-demo.feature`
2. Check console output for "Screenshot attached to Allure" messages
3. Generate and open Allure report
4. Navigate to test details and look for attachment icons ðŸ“Ž
5. Click on screenshot attachments to view full-size images

## ðŸŽ¯ **Result**: Screenshots are now fully visible and properly organized in Allure reports!
